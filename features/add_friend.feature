Feature: Managing my friends
  As a user of Mina V채nner
  I want to add friends to my list
  So that I can keep track of them

  Background:
    Given I am on the Mina V채nner main page

  Scenario: Adding a single friend and checking the list
    When I click "Ny V채n" and add "Ana" with email "ana@example.com"
    And I go to "V채nlista"
    Then I should see "Ana" in the friends list
